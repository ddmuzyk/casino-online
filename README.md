## About

With a plan to add more games to the project in the future, I'm currently focusing on the Texas Hold'em Game.

The player will face opponents (which will be decision making symbolic artificial intellgence) according to the Texas Hold'em rules. Standard poker options will be possible - checking, calling, betting and folding. The game will go on until the player looses all his money (he may also just decide to leave the table) or when all other opponents go broke. 

As it is going to be a full-stack application, users will be able to create their own account where their money will be saved.
